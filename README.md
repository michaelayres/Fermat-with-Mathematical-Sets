# Fermat-with-Mathematical-Sets The promise of Set Theory was that any mathematial problem could be expressed in Set Theory terms.
This project is an Ada programming language applicaieton to explore Femat's Last Theorem using set theory.
Basically, it creates two Sets, the first is more or less static and the second dynamic, based on parameters
It then looks for intersections on the the two sets. We find, of course, intersections for the set of Integers
rasied to the 2nd power, as alredy known as the Pythagorian Theorem. The app is both an exercise for me to
learn Ada program, and explore countless possible intersections.
